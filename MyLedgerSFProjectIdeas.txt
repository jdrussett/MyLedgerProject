Salesforce ledger ideas:

- split expense category allocations
- scheduled apex for recurring expenses
- objects: running balances/accounts, transactions
- chart of total expense makeup (pie chart)
- flows for quick logging expenses
- "projects" to add to type/category
- flows/macros/quick actions for typical/routine expenses?
- reconciled checkbox on accounts/running balances that automatically get unchecked when a new expense is added
- checkbox on expenses for "reflected/reconciled"; expenses automatically added unchecked, running list of expenses still need to balance
- "expecting reimbursement" checkbox on expenses
- expenses/income separate objects? master-detail on reimbursement income items to related expenses getting reimbursed for?
- quick actions/buttons:
    - withdraw cash
    - pay off card
    - transfer
- dashboard elements for last 7 and 30 days expenses
